# Digit Recognizer

In this project, I'm going to build a "Digit Recognizer" using a kaggle dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer). I'm going to do this a few different ways in order to explore the pros and cons of each approach

## Getting Started
I'm using a jupyter notebook (with Python 3) to explore this dataset. The three approaches I'm going to use are as follows:
1. Writing my own functions
2. Using scikit-learn
3. Using TensorFlow
